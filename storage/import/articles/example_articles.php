Instructions:
1. Create a new .php file in /storage/import/articles/.
2. Copy the full $articles array (lines 15-36) below into the new file.
3. Also put the line of "return $articles;" (line 63) at the bottom of the new file.
3. Create one main element (the array of slug, meta_title, and so on) for each article.
4. Fill in the fields for each article to import.
5. Ensure each field follows the provided format and character limits.
6. The 'slug' should be unique for each article.
7. Set 'private' to '1' if the article should not be publicly accessible.
8. Run php artisan db:seed ArticleSeeder to complete the import.
9. All .php files inside the /storage/import/articles/ will now be processed.
10. Delete the .php file containing the $articles array after import, or stash it somewhere.
